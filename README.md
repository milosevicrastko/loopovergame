Simple loopover game solver. The idea is to get familiar with Kotlin programming language and to have little fun while doing it.

How to run:
Like any other Kotlin program, using Intellij. You are not using Intellij for running Kotlin? That means either the future timeline is really messed up, or you are doing something really fun (like setting up vim and kotlin).

Rules of "challenge":

1. Try to get familiar with Kotlin language from "java perspective". Remember, Kotlin was born because of java, try to understand changes Kotlin creators felt were nessessary.
2. Try to implement clean code as much as possible. Let's see how Kotlin vibes with Uncle Bob.
